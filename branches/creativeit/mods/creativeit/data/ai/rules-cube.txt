# rules for an agent to fetch cubes in the environment.

# i0 and i4 are cube sensors on the right and left of agent's heading.
# if activation from cubes is higher on the left, then go towards left.

# otherwise, go towards right (notice that this action is also taken
# if both sensor values are the same, i.e. the agent will go around in
# a clockwise circle until i0/i4 detects cubes).
