# Notes:
# - absolute value of constants in conditions should be greater than 0.1
#   to ensure we are using the desired part of the sigmoid for producing
#   true (value close to 1) and false (value close to 0)
# - constants in set expressions should be between 0.2 and 0.8 to ensure
#   we stay in the mostly linear part of the sigmoid
# - 0.5 is subtracted from output values to get actions
# - since the rules are converted to neural network, the rules are all
#   evaluated in parallel
# - set expressions with the same left hand side produce a value that is
#   the sum of the right hand sides
