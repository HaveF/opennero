=Introduction=

OpenNERO includes several demonstrations of the [http://nn.cs.utexas.edu/?NEAT NEAT] ([http://nn.cs.utexas.edu/?rtNEAT rtNEAT]) algorithm. NEAT is an evolutionary algorithm and adapts the weights and the topologies of neural network controllers.

=Evolving a maze agent=

MazeMod includes the ability to evolve an agent to navigate the maze. After starting the mod, select the *Neuroevolution* button.

=Evolution in the NERO mod=

Like the [http://www.nerogame.org NERO game], NeroMod is built around evolving a population of agents for a variety of tasks. 

After starting the *NERO* mod, set the desired fitness sliders and click *Deploy*. Sliders can be adjusted during the training process to shape the agents via their fitness function.

=Evolving a cleaning robot=

In the RoombaMod, select the *rtNEAT* agents and click *Add Bots* to have them evolve a better cleaning strategy.
