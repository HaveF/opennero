=Evolving a maze agent=

MazeMod includes the ability to evolve a solution 

=Evolution in the NERO mod=

Like the [http://www.nerogame.org NERO game], NeroMod is built around evolving a population of agents for a variety of tasks. This is achieved through changing the fitness function using the sliders.

=Evolving a cleaning robot=

In the RoombaMod, select the *rtNEAT* agents and click *Add Bots* to have them evolve a better cleaning strategy.
