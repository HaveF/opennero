#summary Describe how to build OpenNERO for a variety of platforms.

= Overview =

OpenNERO uses the [http://www.cmake.org/ CMake] cross-platform build system. In general, to build OpenNERO, you will first call cmake to produce IDE and operating system specific build files, and then use your IDE or build command to produce the binary. OpenNERO can be built on Linux, Mac OS X and Windows using Xcode, GNU make, Eclipse and Microsoft Visual Studio.
