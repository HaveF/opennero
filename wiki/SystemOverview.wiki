#summary This page describes the core API for OpenNERO agents and environments.
#sidebar TableOfContents

OpenNERO is a federation of several _mods_ - nearly independent
collections of resources and scripts stored in individual directories.
For example, there are the [MazeMod Maze mod], the [NeroMod NERO mod] 
and the [RoombaMod Roomba mod] - see [RunningOpenNero Running OpenNERO]
for more details.

Since OpenNERO is all about designing intelligent agents, it has an 
API for adding new _agents_ and new _environments_ to test them in. 
An agent can interact with an environment by receiving _observations_ 
from it, sending it _actions_, and receiving _rewards_ for those 
actions. Agents in OpenNERO extend the class `AgentBrain`. 
Environments extend the `Environment` class. Both agents and 
environments can be written in Python or in C++.
