#summary This page describes the core API for OpenNERO agents and environments.
#sidebar TableOfContents

OpenNERO is a federation of several _mods_ - nearly independent
collections of resources and scripts stored in individual directories.
For example, there are the [MazeMod Maze mod], the [NeroMod NERO mod] 
and the [RoombaMod Roomba mod] - see [RunningOpenNero Running OpenNERO]
for more details.

Since OpenNERO is all about designing intelligent agents, it has an 
API for adding new _agents_ and new _environments_ to test them in. 
An agent can interact with an environment by receiving _observations_ 
from it, sending it _actions_, and receiving _rewards_ for those 
actions. Agents in OpenNERO extend the class `AgentBrain`. 
Environments extend the `Environment` class. Both agents and 
environments can be written in Python or in C++.

The main interfaces (which are defined in C++ and exported into Python) look like this:

===[http://code.google.com/p/opennero/source/browse/trunk/source/ai/Environment.h Environment]===
  * *sense*(agent): `Observations`
  * *step*(agent, action): `Reward`
  * *get_agent_info*(agent): `AgentInitInfo`
  * *is_episode_over*(agent): boolean
  * *cleanup*(agent)
  * *reset*(agent)

===[http://code.google.com/p/opennero/source/browse/trunk/source/ai/AgentBrain.h AgentBrain]===
  * *initialize*(agent_init_info)
  * *start*(time, observations): `Actions`
  * *act*(time, observations, reward): `Actions`
  * *end*(time, observations, reward)
  * *destroy*()
