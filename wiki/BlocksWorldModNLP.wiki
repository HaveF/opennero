=Tower of Hanoi Environment=

Blocks World is a classical test problem for traditional AI techniques such as symbolic planning, natural language understanding, and even robotics. The idea is to manipulate simple objects (blocks) that can be moved around and stacked on top of each other. While it is a relatively simple domain, it hides some surprising challenges and provides a good illustration for some fundamental principles of AI.

Currently the "Towers of Hanoi" problem is implemented in the Blocks
World, and it is used to demonstrate different planning methods.
