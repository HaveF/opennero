{{{
sudo apt-get install openjdk-6-jre
}}}

OpenNERO depends on some boost libraries.  You may have to replace the version numbers to match what the latest binary has been linked against:

{{{
sudo apt-get install libboost-python1.46.1 libboost-libboost-filesystem1.46.1 libboost-serialization1.46.1 libboost-system1.46.1 libboost-date-time1.46.1
