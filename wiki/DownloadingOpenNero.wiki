OpenNERO depends on the following packages:

If you do not have python installed, install it using your package manager. To do so on Ubuntu Linux, use:

{{{

}}}

The current build of OpenNERO also depends on Java.  You need to install a JRE to be able to use the training window in the NERO game:

{{{
sudo apt-get install openjdk-6-jre
}}}

OpenNERO depends on some boost libraries.  You may need to replace the version numbers to match what the latest binary has been linked against:

{{{
sudo apt-get install libboost-python1.46.1 libboost-libboost-filesystem1.46.1 libboost-serialization1.46.1 libboost-system1.46.1 libboost-date-time1.46.1
}}}

You also need these additional packages for running various mods:

{{{
sudo apt-get install python-wxgtk2.8 python-tk python-matplotlib python-scipy python-numpy python-imaging-tk 
}}}
