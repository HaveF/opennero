=Maze Mod=

The Maze is a simple 2-D grid world with a variety of search, learning, and first person agents implemented.

==Controls==

 * *Esc* - exit the Maze and return to the Hub
 * *F1* - get help by opening the web browser and navigating to this page
 * *A* - move camera left
 * *D* - move camera right
 * *W* - move camera forward
 * *S* - move camera back
 * *Q* - pan camera left
 * *E* - pan camera right
 * *space bar* - recenter camera to origin

==What the display means==

 * Red cube - goal position (opposite of the starting position)
 * Yellow marker - next location the agent is going to
 * Blue marker - past locations the agent has already visited
 * Green markers - active locations the agent may return to
 * White markers - found path

==User Interface==

The button panel lists the different types of agents available for the Maze:
 * Depth First Search - starts the depth first search agent   
 * `A*` search with three different types of visualizations
 * First person control - use the arrow keys to try to solve the maze yourself!
 * Random baseline - the agent picks actions randomly, just to see how well that will work
 * Neuroevolution - the agent is controlled by neural networks whose structure and weights are evolved using the rtNEAT neuroevolution algorithm according to the fitness function that rewards getting to the goal without hitting the walls
 * Sarsa - the agent learns from reinforcement signal using the on-policy learning algorithm (tabular, no approximation)
 * Q-Learning - the agent learns from reinforcement signal using the off-policy learning algorithm (tabular, no approximation)
