    * Negative: Rewarded for large distance to closest allied agent (Based on Distance Slider)
  * Approach Enemy:
    * Positive: Rewarded for small distance to closest enemy agent (Based on Distance Slider)
    * Negative: Rewarded for large distance to closest enemy agent (Based on Distance Slider)
  * Approach Flag:
    * Positive: Rewarded for small distance to flag (Based on Distance Slider)
    * Negative: Rewarded for large distance to flag (Based on Distance Slider)
  * Hit Target:
    * Positive: Rewarded for hitting enemy agents
    * Negative: Punished for hitting enemy agents
  * Avoid Fire:
    * Positive: Punished for having hit points reduced
    * Negative: Rewarded for having hit points reduced

  * Lifetime: The number of action steps each agent gets to perform before being removed from the simulation
  * Friendly Fire: The % of damage which allied units take from being hit by an ally
  * Explore/Exploit: The % of generated agents which are the best of previous generations being reevaluated (This tends to be important in coevolution)
  * Hitpoints: The amount of damage a unit can take before dying (Note: being hit by an enemy is 1 point of damage)

  * Train: Use the above settings
  * Fight: Set Exploit to 100%, reset population, lifetime to infinity, hitpoints to 1. Designed for simulation of battles between coevolved troops.

===Current Implementation Notes===
 * Unfortunately, moving the flag and army spawn points is not currently implemented. This is in the works however.
