=The NERO Mod=

The Nero mod provides an interface for users to modify the fitness function live and see the effects of these changes in the behaviour of the agents

http://opennero.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/OpenNERO-nero.png

==Controls==

  * *W* - Up
  * *A* - Left
  * *S* - Down
  * *D* - Right
  * *Q* - Rotate Left
  * *E* - Rotate Right

==What the Display Means==
  * *People* - Agents. Depending on their spawn point they are of one of two populations of agents
  * *Trees, Walls, Etc.* - Obstacles, these cannot be moved through, and themselves do not move
  * *Blue Cube* - Current Flag Location

==User Interface==

The Button and Slider Panel lists the command and fitness parameter settings for the game.
  * The Large Button: Spawns Agents
  * Stand Ground:
    * Positive: Punished for nonzero movement velocity
    * Negative: Rewarded for nonzero movement velocity
  * Stick Together:
    * Positive: Rewarded for small distance to closest allied agent (Based on Distance Slider)
    * Negative: Rewarded for large distance to closest allied agent (Based on Distance Slider)
  * Approach Enemy:
    * Positive: Rewarded for small distance to closest enemy agent (Based on Distance Slider)
    * Negative: Rewarded for large distance to closest enemy agent (Based on Distance Slider)
  * Approach Flag:
    * Positive: Rewarded for small distance to flag (Based on Distance Slider)
    * Negative: Rewarded for large distance to flag (Based on Distance Slider)
  * Hit Target:
    * Positive: Rewarded for hitting enemy agents
    * Negative: Punished for hitting enemy agents
  * Avoid Fire:
    * Positive: Punished for having hit points reduced
    * Negative: Rewarded for having hit points reduced

  * Lifetime: The number of action steps each agent gets to perform before being removed from the simulation
  * Friendly Fire: The % of damage which allied units take from being hit by an ally
  * Explore/Exploit: The % of generated agents which are the best of previous generations being reevaluated (This tends to be important in coevolution)
  * Hitpoints: The amount of damage a unit can take before dying (Note: being hit by an enemy is 1 point of damage)

  * Train: Use the above settings
  * Fight: Set Exploit to 100%, reset population, lifetime to infinity, hitpoints to 1. Designed for simulation of battles between coevolved troops.

Please note that the fitness settings are the same for both populations

#===Current Implementation Notes===
# * Unfortunately, moving the flag and army spawn points is not currently implemented. #This is in the works however.
