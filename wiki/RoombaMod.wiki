=Roomba Mod=

The Roomba environment is a virtual computer lab with crumbs distributed on the floor. The agents collect the crumbs and receive reward for doing so.

==Controls==

 * *Esc* - exit the Maze and return to the Hub

==What the display means==

 * Blue cubes: bread crumbs (or pieces of trash) on the floor, which the vacuum cleaners must pick up
 * Grey cylinders: vacuum cleaner agents
 * Walls: the limits of the environment
 * Tables, Chairs, Computers: at the moment these are only decorations

==User Interface==

The control panel allows you to select the number of agents to run, as well as the policy used to control them. You can select a scripted agent that greedily selects the closest crumb and moves to collect it, or an evolving agent that improves with time. 

==Some functionality provided by the scripting language==
Changing Blue cube distribution:
 * [http://code.google.com/p/opennero/source/browse/trunk/mods/Roomba/world_config.txt world_config.txt] *can* hold all information needed to distribute the Blue cubes. You can think of this file as a very rudimentary "map" or "scenario," as the term is used in strategy games. 
    * The first few lines under Dimensions list the sizes of the room. However, these are only filler at the moment.
    * Each line under "Pellets" hold information about one Blue cube. A typical line may look like this: 
{{{1	cluster	86.8597775308	20.5101799601	7.31971084367	7.31971084367}}}
    * The first number ("1") is the amount of reward the robot gets for picking up this particular Blue cube
    * "cluster" specify the kind of distribution that this Blue cube belong to. In the case of "cluster", this cube will be placed randomly but close to a certain point. If we have bunch of cubes with identical information, they will "cluster" together, thus the name. The other options for this field are "manual" and "random" (uniform randomization).
    * The numbers that follow are other pieces of information used to generate the position of this Blue cube. Here, from left to right, we have the x and y coordinate of the cluster center, and about 1/3 of the x and y spread, respectively.
