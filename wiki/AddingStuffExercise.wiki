==Introduction==

In this exercise, you will go through the steps required to create a Mod consisting of a flat terrain surrounded by four walls and a simple environment with an agent that can move around. This exercise can be done either with the [http://code.google.com/p/opennero/source/browse/ working copy of the source] or with one of the [http://code.google.com/p/opennero/downloads/list binary distributions].

 * If working with source, use the `mods` directory and update the application build to copy your files into the product folder `dist`.
 * If working with a binary distribution, use the same folder as the executable on Windows and Linux, or `OpenNERO.app/Contents/Resources` folder on Mac OS X (right click on the app to "Show Package Contents".

==Creating a Mod==

 * Create a new sub-folder in the mods directory you are using.
 * Create two (empty) files: *main.py* and *__init__.py*
 * In *main.py*, define the ModMain function: {{{
def ModMain():
    print 'Hello, Mod!'
}}}
 * This is the function that will get called when you load your mod.
 * If using source, update the build
 * Run the application

You should see a button appear for your mod in the Hub menu. When you press this button, you should see an empty screen and the output log (usually nero_log.txt) should contain 'Hello, Mod!'. Congratulations, you've added a mod!

Now let's make it more useful.
