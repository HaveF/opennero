==Introduction==

In this exercise, you will go through the steps required to create a Mod consisting of a flat terrain surrounded by four walls and a simple environment with an agent that can move around. This exercise can be done either with the [http://code.google.com/p/opennero/source/browse/ working copy of the source] or with one of the [http://code.google.com/p/opennero/downloads/list binary distributions].

 * If working with source, use the `mods` directory and update the application build to copy your files into the product folder `dist`.
 * If working with a binary distribution, use the same folder as the executable on Windows and Linux, or `OpenNERO.app/Contents/Resources` folder on Mac OS X (right click on the app to "Show Package Contents".
