==Running the Demo==

<wiki:video url="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-8ixTTZtWA" />

To run the demo:
  # [RunningOpenNero start OpenNERO]
  # Start the [MazeMod Maze mod]
  # Click on Depth First Search and observe the resulting behavior. Note:
    # The maze can be abstracted as a graph of cells connected by edges where there are no walls
    # Blue square markers represent visited nodes
    # When the agent runs into a dead-end, it has to retrace its steps to get to the next branch
    # When the agent reaches to goal, it displays the path to it with white square markers
  # Click on Breadth First Search and observe the resulting behavior. Note:
    # The maze can be abstracted as a graph of cells connected by edges where there are no walls
    # Blue square markers represent visited nodes
    # Green squares mark the node of the same depth that the agent still needs to visit
    # Yellow square marks the node where the agent needs to go next
    # Since there is a lot more retracing the agent would need to do for a Breadth First exploration, we allow it to "Teleport" from place to place.
    # When the agent reaches to goal, it displays the path to it with white square markers

==Breadth First Search==

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search Breadth-First Search] (see section 3.4.1 of [http://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/ AIMA]) is a technique for searching a graph or a tree-like structure by exploring all leaves of the same depth first. MazeMod includes an agent that searches for the target (red square) by expanding the graph representing the maze in a breadth-first manner.

==Depth First Search==

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search Depth-First Search] (see section 3.4.3 of [http://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/ AIMA]) is a technique for searching a graph or a tree-like structure. MazeMod includes an agent that searches for the target (red square) by expanding the graph representing the maze in a depth-first manner.

Here is how to run Depth First Search in OpenNERO:

  # start OpenNERO and select Maze.
  # Once the maze is displayed, click Depth First Search.
  # The agent marks the locations on the maze where it has been with blue marker boxes.
  # If the agent reaches a dead-end, it will retrace its steps to the most recent un-expanded branch of the graph representing the maze.
