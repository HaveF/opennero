= Requirements =

In order to run OpenNERO on your platform you may need to install Python and wxPython.

== On Windows, ==

Download and install [http://www.python.org/getit/ Python 2.7.2 (win32)] and [http://www.wxpython.org/download.php wxPython] (required for the NERO mod). You will also need to add the directory with python.exe (usually C:\Python27) to your PATH environment variable.

== On Mac OS X, ==

Python is already installed. Download and install the [http://www.wxpython.org/download.php wxPython] binary for your platform (required for the NERO mod).

== On Linux, ==

If you do not have python installed, install it using your package manager. To do so on Ubuntu Linux, use:

{{{
sudo apt-get install python python-wxgtk2.8
}}}

= Introduction =

OpenNERO consists of the core program and a collection of one or more *mods*. A mod is a logically separate unit of OpenNERO that can be a custom game, an AI experiment, or both. Each mod is defined as a directory next to the application. When you start OpenNERO, it shows a menu with existing mods and an option to exit. Currently, the following mods are included:
  * [MazeMod Maze] - a simple maze world on an island, with search, learning and first-person agents.
  * [BlocksWorldMod Blocks World] - a classic AI problem for planning and natural language understanding.
  * [RoombaMod Roomba] - a messy computer lab which gets cleaner with the help of some cleaning robots.
  * [NeroMod NERO] - an implementation of [http://www.nerogame.org/ Neuro Evolving Robotic Operatives (NERO)], where you can evolve your own team of neural network-driven robots along a variety of fitness criteria.
