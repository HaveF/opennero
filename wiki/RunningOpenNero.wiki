= Introduction =

OpenNERO consists of a the core program and a collection of one or more *mods*. A mod is a logically separate unit of OpenNERO that can be a custom game, an AI experiment, or both. Each mod is defined as a directory next to the application. When you start OpenNERO, it shows a menu with existing mods and an option to exit. Currently, there are three mods:
 * Maze - a simple maze world on an island, with search, learning and first-person agents.
 * Roomba - a messy computer lab which gets cleaner with the help of some cleaning robots.
 * NERO - a partial implementation of [http://www.nerogame.org/ Neuro Evolving Robotic Operatives (NERO)], where you can evolve your own team of neural network-driven robots along a variety of fitness criteria.
