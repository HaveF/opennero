= Prerequisites =

Please be sure to follow the instructions to install [OpenNeroPrerequisites Prerequisites] (Python and wxPython).

= Introduction =

OpenNERO consists of the core program and a collection of one or more *mods*. A mod is a logically separate unit of OpenNERO that can be a custom game, an AI experiment, or both. Each mod is defined as a directory next to the application. When you start OpenNERO, it shows a menu with existing mods and an option to exit. Currently, the following mods are included:
  * [MazeMod Maze] - a simple maze world on an island, with search, learning and first-person agents.
  * [BlocksWorldMod Blocks World] - a classic AI problem for planning and natural language understanding.
  * [RoombaMod Roomba] - a messy computer lab which gets cleaner with the help of some cleaning robots.
  * [NeroMod NERO] - an implementation of [http://www.nerogame.org/ Neuro Evolving Robotic Operatives (NERO)], where you can evolve your own team of neural network-driven robots along a variety of fitness criteria.

= Controls =

The controls can be easily redefined, but in general, the following keys should work:

  * *F1* - help (opens the browser to show this page)
  * *A* - move camera left
  * *D* - move camera right
  * *W* - move camera forward
  * *S* - move camera back
  * *Q* - pan camera left
  * *E* - pan camera right
  * *R* - tilt camera up
  * *F* - tilt camera down
  * *space bar* - recenter camera to origin
  * *ESC* - exit the currently running mod
  * *Mouse Scroll* - zoom in or zoom out
  * *Z* - zoom in
  * *C* - zoom out
