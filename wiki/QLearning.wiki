[http://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~sutton/book/ebook/node65.html Q-Learning] is a type of time-difference [http://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~sutton/book/the-book.html Reinforcement Learning] that uses a _value function_ to pick the best action.

In MazeMod, a Q-Learning reinforcement agent leans to navigate the maze from experience. To start this demonstration, start OpenNERO and click on the Maze button. Once the maze loads, click the Q-Learning button. You can adjust the fraction of the actions taken greedily vs actions taken to explore the environment using the explore-exploit slider.
