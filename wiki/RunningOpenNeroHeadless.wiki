#summary How to run OpenNERO without invoking the graphical user interface
#labels Exercise

= Introduction =

When running experiments, you might want to run OpenNERO multiple times to explore parameter settings or make statistically significant comparisons. When doing so, it is nice to automate this process or even to distribute multiple runs of OpenNERO to a bunch of machines in a cluster. This is how we, for example, ran the [TournamentResults2011 OpenNERO Tournament].

= Details =

The basic process is pretty straightforward:
 # make OpenNERO run your experiment immediately after it starts and record any data you might want later into a log file
 # write a script that starts OpenNERO in _headless_ mode (without GUI) and stops it after the experiment is completed
 # either run this script manually or use a cluster system like Condor to run it for you

We will use the OpenNERO tournament runner to illustrate how this is done. See [http://code.google.com/p/opennero/wiki/TournamentResults2011#Running_your_own_tournament Running Your Own Tournament] for an explanation of what it allows you to do. The scripts used in these examples can be found in [/p/opennero/source/browse/#svn%2Ftrunk%2Fmisc%2Ftourney misc/tourney].
