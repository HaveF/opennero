#summary This page describes one method for creating animated character data in a format that can be used in OpenNERO.

==To produce an md2 file containing animated character data that can be used in OpenNERO:==

  # Create an animated model in a program that can export the obj format.
    * I've only used Maya, but obj is a simple and common format, so other programs are likely to work as well.
    * The md2 format requires that all textures for this model be contained in a single image file.
  # Export one obj file for each frame of each animation you want your character to have
    * Example filenames: run001.obj, run002.obj, ... , stand001.obj, stand002.obj ...
    * For Maya, I have included a [ExportMD2Example script] that I used to automate this process.  (This script will require some straightforward modification to match your particular animation.)
  # Run obj_to_md2 on these obj files and their texture file.
    * Compile from [ObjToMD2Main main.cpp] and [ObjToMD2Makefile Makefile].
    * Run obj_to_md2 with no arguments for usage.
