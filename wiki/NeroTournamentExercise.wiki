= NERO Machine Learning Tournament =

In this exercise, you will use either the rtNEAT algorithm or
Reinforcement Learning to train a team OpenNero agents to defeat your
opponents in battle. We will run a tournament in class, where we will
pit the teams against each other in an apocalyptic battle for world
domination (or something). Follow the steps below, unless of course
you're comfortable getting destroyed by your opponents who did.

==0. Install prerequisites for running OpenNERO==

See OpenNeroPrerequisites for detailed instructions for your platform.

==1. Install the OpenNERO Platform==

OpenNERO runs on Linux, Mac OSX, and Windows platforms. In order to
install it on your system, you can either:

  * Install it on your own machine by downloading one of the [http://code.google.com/p/opennero/downloads/list prebuilt binaries]. Note that they do require that you have some additional software installed, such as Python and wxPython (see instructions on the [http://code.google.com/p/opennero/downloads/list download page]).
  * [BuildingOpenNero Build OpenNERO] on your own machine using the source code.

If you build from the source, you can modify and extend the game
yourself (for the tournament, or otherwise), but no such modifications
are necessary to train and enter the tournament.

==2. Train Your Team==

The game is described in detail in the [NeroMod NERO game] page,
including specific instructions on how you can train your team.
Please read that page carefully.

==3. Submit Your Team to the Tournament==

After you are satisfied with your team, you'll save it into a file, and submit that file into the tournament. Specific instructions on how to submit will be posted here in the near future. The deadline for submission is *December 15th, 2011 at 11:59pm CST.*

==4. Eagerly Await the Results==

We will collect all submissions after the deadline and run a
double-elimination tournament on them. The tournament will be seeded
randomly.  The standard NERO Battle environment will be used for the
games; because the environment is symmetric, each team can be assigned
as Red or Blue randomly without providing an advantage to either one.
Each game will be run until one team is eliminated, or when a timeout
of 5 minutes is reached, in which case the team that has more hits
will win. In case of a tie, the winner will be chosen randomly, except
for the final game, which will be repeated until there is an actual
winner based on hits.

The tournament results will be posted a few days after the deadline on
[TournamentResults2011 this website], including videos of the final games. The teams
will be identified by the name provided in the submission.

==Debugging, Discussion, and Bug Fixes==

If you run into any bugs in your program, you can find the error log file for OpenNERO (see OpenNeroLogs)

We encourage discussion of topics related to the tournament, and have
established [http://groups.google.com/group/opennero OpenNERO Google group] to support it. Questions can be posted in that discussion forum
and answered by anyone on the forum, hopefully making it
easier to figure out issues as they happen.

In order to provide the best experience for everyone, we may release
bug fixes before the tournament submissions are due.
