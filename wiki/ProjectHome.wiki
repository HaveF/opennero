== About OpenNERO ==

[http://nn.cs.utexas.edu/?opennero OpenNERO] is an open source software platform designed for
research and education in Artificial Intelligence. The project is based on the
[http://www.nerogame.org/ Neuro-Evolving Robotic Operatives (NERO) game] developed by graduate
and undergraduate students at the  [http://nn.cs.utexas.edu/ Neural Networks Research Group] and
[http://www.cs.utexas.edu/ Department of Computer Science] at the
[http://www.utexas.edu/ University of Texas at Austin].

In particular, OpenNERO has been used to implement several demos and exercises for the Russell
and Norvig's textbook [http://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/ Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach].  These
demos and exercises illustrate AI methods such as brute-force search, heuristic search, scripting,
reinforcement learning, and evolutionary computation, and AI problems such as maze running,
vacuuming, and robotic battle. The methods and problems are implemented in several different
environments (or "mods"), as described below.

More environments, problems, and methods, as well as demos and exercises illustrating them, will
be added in the future. The current ones are intended to serve as a starting point on which new
ones can be built, by us, but also by the community at large. If you'd like to contribute
something you have built, you can reach project managers at
[mailto:opennero-questions@googlegroups.com opennero-questions].

== Get Started ==

You can download a  [http://code.google.com/p/opennero/downloads/list binary build of OpenNERO] for
your platform, or checkout the current source and [BuildingOpenNero build it yourself]. You
can then [OpenNeroDemos try out the various demos], [OpenNeroExercises work on the exercises],
or [RunningOpenNero explore the various mods] on your own.
