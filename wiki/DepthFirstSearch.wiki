[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search Depth-First Search] (see section 3.4.3 of [http://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/ AIMA]) is a technique for searching a graph or a tree-like structure. MazeMod includes an agent that searches for the target (red square) by expanding the graph in a depth-first manner.

Here is how to run Depth First Search in OpenNERO:

  # start OpenNERO and select Maze.
  # Once the maze is displayed, click Depth First Search.
  # The agent marks the locations on the maze where it has been with blue marker boxes.
  # If the agent reaches a dead-end, it will retrace its steps to the most recent un-expanded branch of the graph representing the maze.

The source code for this and other Maze agents is in [http://code.google.com/p/opennero/source/browse/trunk/mods/Maze/agent.py agent.py].
