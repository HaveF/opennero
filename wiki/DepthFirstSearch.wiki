[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search Depth-First Search] is a technique for searching a graph or a tree-like structure. MazeMod includes an agent that searches for the target (red square) by expanding the graph in a depth-first manner.

To demonstrate, start OpenNERO and select Maze.

Once the maze is displayed, click Depth First Search.

The agent marks the locations on the maze where it has been with blue marker boxes.

If the agent reaches a dead-end, it will retrace its steps to the most recent un-expanded branch of the graph representing the maze.

The source code for this and other Maze agents is in [http://code.google.com/p/opennero/source/browse/trunk/mods/Maze/agent.py agent.py].
